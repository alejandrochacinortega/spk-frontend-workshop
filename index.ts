// Welcome to your first TypeScript file.

// TypeScript is like JavaScript + Types, meaning that you MUST specify types and a description to your code.
// Look at these examples before you jump into the code


  // TODO 1: Create a console log that prints "Hello World using TypeScript"


  // TODO 2: Now you need to transpile the TypeScript file into a JavaScript file.
  // TODO 2: In order to do so, go to your terminar and "tsc",
  // TODO 2: Once you run that command, you should see that a "dist" folder was created. And a new file called "index.js".
  // NOTE that for every change you make in this file, you need to run "tsc", then "node dist/index.js".



  // TODO 3: Run "index.js" by typing "node index.js" in your terminal.
  // TODO 3: Check that you see "Hello World using TypeScript" in the console


  // TODO 4: üéäÔ∏è Congrats! You just created your first Hello World using TypeScript.
